EXAMPLE:

λ> t9
(λa.λb.(a (a (a b))) λc.λd.(c (c d)))
λ> simplifyIO t9
(λa.λb.(a (a (a b))) λc.λd.(c (c d)))
λb.(λc.λd.(c (c d)) (λc.λd.(c (c d)) (λc.λd.(c (c d)) b)))
λb.λd.(λd.(λd.(b (b d)) (λd.(b (b d)) d)) (λd.(λd.(b (b d)) (λd.(b (b d)) d)) d))
λb.λd.(b (b (b (b (b (b (b (b d))))))))
λb.λd.(b (b (b (b (b (b (b (b d))))))))
